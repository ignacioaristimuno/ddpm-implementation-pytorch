# Generative AI applied to Medical Imagery

![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/memray)

In this repository we explore different approaches for generating medical images based on some public benchmark datasets that have been open-sourced. This work was being held within the framework of the thesis of the Master's in Big Data of the ORT University, in Uruguay.

We first introduce some basic implementations on traditional image datasets such as CIFAR or MNIST, using the techniques that will be used later for medical imagery. These techniques include:
- Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which are the focus of this thesis.
- Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs).
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
